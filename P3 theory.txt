The Food Ordering System Example
Context DFD
A context diagram is a data flow diagram that only shows the top level, otherwise known as
Level 0. At this level, there Is only one visible process node that represents the functions of a
complete systern in regards to how it interacts with external entities. Some of the benefits of
a Context Diagram are
1. Shows the overview of the boundaries of a system
2. No technical knowledge is required to understand with the sinple notation
3. Simple to draw, amend and elaborate as its limited notation
The figure below shows a context Data Flow Diagrarn that is drawn for a Food Ordering
System. It contains a process (shape) that represents the system to nodel, in this case, the
"Food Ordering Systern. It also shows the participants who will interact with the system,
called the external entities. In this example, the Supplier, Kitchen, Manager, and Custormer
are the entities who will interact with the system. in between the process and the external
entities, there is data flow (connectaors) that indicate the existence of information exchange
between the entities and the system. 

Context DFD is the entrance of a data flow model. It contains one and only one process and
does not show any data store.
Level 1 DFA
The figure below shows the level 1 DFD, which is the decomposition (e. break down) of the
Food Ordering Systen process shown in the context DFD. Read through the diagram and
then we will introduce some of the key concepts based on this diagram.
